DES linear data Cutoff for CosmoMC
==================================

The code in this repo is used to produce the linear data cutoffs for the Dark Energy Surver (DES) used in CosmoMC

This code is used in [MGCosmoMC](https://github.com/sfu-cosmo/MGCosmoMC). 

## 1. Installing:
To install this code on your machine, type the following commands on the terminal
